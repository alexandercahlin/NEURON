<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<code>checkpoint("<var>filename</var>")</code><br>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
	saves the current state of the system in a portable file to
	allow one to take up where you left off --- possibly on another
	machine. Returning to this state is accomplished by running the
	program with the checkpoint file as the first argument.
	If the checkpoint file is inconsistent with the executable the
	program prints an error message and exits.
<p>
	At this time many portions of the computer state are left out of the
	checkpoint file. ie it is not as complete as a core dump.
	Some things that ARE included are:
	All interpreter symbols with definitions and values,
	all hoc instructions,
	all neuron state/parameters with mechanisms.
	Many aspects of the GUI are not included.
<p>
	there is not enough implementation at this time to make this
	facility useful.
