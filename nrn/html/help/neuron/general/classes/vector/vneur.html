<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<code>v1.trigavg(<var>data</var>,<var>trigger</var>,<var>pre</var>,<var>post</var>)</code><br>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Perform an event-triggered average of <<var>data</var>> using times given by
<<var>trigger</var>>. The duration of the average is from -<<var>pre</var>> to <<var>post</var>>.
This is useful, for example, in calculating a spike triggered stimulus
average.

<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<code>v.spikebin(<var>data</var>,<var>thresh</var>)</code><br>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Used to make a binary version of a spike train.  <<var>data</var>> is a vector
of membrane potential.  <<var>thresh</var>> is the voltage threshold for spike
detection.  <<var>v</var>> is set to all zeros except at the onset of spikes
(the first dt which the spike crosses threshold)

<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<code>vmeanfreq = vdest.psth(<var>vsrchist</var>,<var>dt</var>,<var>trials</var>,<var>size</var>)</code><br>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
The name of this function is somewhat misleading, since its
input, vsrchist, is a finely-binned post-stimulus time histogram,
and its output, vdest, is an array whose elements are the mean
frequencies f_mean[i] that correspond to each bin of vsrchist.
<p>
For bin i, the corresponding mean frequency f_mean[i] is
determined by centering an adaptive square window on i and
widening the window until the number of spikes under the
window equals size.  Then f_mean[i] is calculated as
<p>
<code>  f_mean[i] = N[i] / (m dt trials) </code>
<p>
where
<pre>
  f_mean[i] is in spikes per _second_ (Hz).
  N[i] = total number of events in the window
           centered on bin i
  m = total number of bins in the window
           centered on bin i
  dt = binwidth of vsrchist in _milliseconds_
           (so m dt is the width of the window in milliseconds)
  trials = an integer scale factor
</pre>
<p>
trials is used to adjust for the number of traces that were
superimposed to compute the elements of vsrchist.  In other words,
suppose the elements of vsrchist were computed by adding up the
number of spikes in n traces
<pre>
              n
  v1.x[i] = SUMMA # of spikes in bin i of trace j
            j = 1
</pre>
Then trials would be assigned the value n.  Of course, if
the elements of vsrchist are divided by n before calling psth(),
then trials should be set to 1.
<p>

The documentation and example for psth was prepared by Ted Carnevale.
<h2>BUGS</h2>
The total number of spikes in vsrchist must be greater than size.
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<blockquote><pre>
VECSIZE = 200
MINSUM = 50
DT = 1000	// ms per bin of v1 (vsrchist)
TRIALS = 1

objref v1, v2
v1 = new Vector(VECSIZE)
  
objref r
r = new Random()
           
  
for (ii=0; ii&lt;VECSIZE; ii+=1) {

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Simulate a leaky integrate and fire neuron.  <<var>i</var>> is a vector containing
the input.  <<var>dt</var>> is the timestep.  <<var>gl</var>> and <<var>el</var>> are the conductance
and reversal potential of the leak term <<var>cm</var>> is capacitance.  <<var>th</var>>
is the threshold voltage and <<var>res</var>> is the reset voltage. <<var>ref</var>>, if
present sets the duration of ab absolute refractory period.
 
N.b. Currently working with forward Euler integration, which may give
spurious results.
