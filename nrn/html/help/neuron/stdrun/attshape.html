These tools plot various functions of <a href="../neuron/classes/impedanc.html#Impedance">Impedance</a> vs
location and frequency.
<p>
Each tool has three panels: The top
panel contains button and menu controls specific to the tool. The
middle panel displays a picture of the cell and marks the measurement
and injection sites. The bottom panel displays the results of the
impedance measurements.
<p>
The redraw button in the top panel forces a re-calculation of the results.
This is useful if a parameter or state changes in the underlying model
of the cell. The "Extras/MovieMode" menu item recalculated the results
for each step during a <a href="runctrl.html#InitRun">InitRun</a> . When selected,
the "Extras/AutoScale" rescales
the results panel after each calculation.
<p>
The "Plot" menu specifies whether to plot log attenuation (default),
input impedance, transfer impedance, or V(measure)/V(inject)
Note: log attenuation is defined as ln( V(inject)/V(measure) )
Input impedance is plotted with
respect to the measurement site and the injection site is unused.

Tool for generating the neuromorphic rendering, a picture of the
neuron in which distance is scaled to represent the log of
voltage attenuation. In this transform,
long distance represents large attenuation.
<p>
The tool consists of three panels. The middle panel shows the normal
unscaled shape of the neuron on which the user can select a measurement/injection
site (default location is location 0 of the currently accessed section
when the ImpShape object was created). The lower panel displays
a neuromorphic rendering along with a unit attenuation scale bar.
The upper control panel allows selection of the frequency at which to
calculate the impedance and the direction of current flow, Vin/Vout,
with respect
to the measurement/injection site.
<p>
When "Vin" is selected one can imagine that
for every point on the cell, that point is voltage clamped to 1 mV and
the voltage at the measurement site (0 end of the selected section in
the lower panel) is recorded. The shape of the neuron
is then plotted so that the distance between the
voltage clamp site and the measurement site is the natural
log of the attenuation
factor, ln( V(inject)/V(measure) )
<p>
When "Vout" is selected, one can imagine that the selected position
becomes voltage clamped to 1mV and the voltage at every other position
on the cell is measured.
