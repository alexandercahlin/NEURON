	The Print window manager gives special meaning to each mouse button
	as described in the PrintWindowManager section.
<p>
	This interface is profligate in its use of windows. In the course
	of a simulation it is expected that windows will be created and
	destroyed freely. In OpenLook one dismisses a window merely by
	pressing the right(menu) button in the window header area and
	selecting dismiss. If your window manager does not support easy
	dismissing of windows then you *MUST* invoke nrniv with the
	automatic dismiss button feature. The default widget style is
	MOTIF but openlook style can be selected. The relevant options are
<p>
		nrniv -dismissbutton -openlook ...

	Graphs and Shape windows are instances of views into a scene.<br>
<a href="scene.hoc">execute following example</a>
<blockquote><pre>
// pop up an example of a scene
</pre></blockquote>
	A scene is defined as the space represented by the model
	coordinate system. A view is defined as that portion of the scene
	which is drawn in the window.
	There can be many views into a scene and each scene has its own
	menu selections but they can be different for different scenes.
	Scenes use an openlook style in which the right(menu) mouse button
	pops up menus from which one either selects an action to be performed
	immediately, eg. Round or Whole Scene, or else selects a meaning for
	the left(select) mouse button which will be used when the left mouse
	button is pressed within any view of that particular scene. This can
	be thought of as selecting a tool with the right button and wielding
	that tool with the left button.
	These menu items are like radio buttons in that only one is active at
	a time. It is recommended that when you move into a view you quickly
	pop up the menu so you can be certain of the meaning of the left button.
	The middle button translates the view around the scene. All
	scenes have a common View menu as the first menu item
	with which one can create a new view, zoom in/out, round the view
	or make the view correspond to the natural size of the scene.

The left button highlights a selection. Double clicking generally executes
the selection. Browsers are used to select files for printing,
variables for plotting, etc. Sometimes, a browser has a field editor in which
one can directly type an entry. Usually after an item has been selected you
have to press an Accept or Cancel button to actually execute the selection.
Browsers can be scrolled with d,u,j,k,n,p and others.

Field editors accept a string entered by the user.  The allowed strings

button).  Field editors have an emacs-like syntax and typing characters
inserts them at the cursor.  The left mouse button specifies the cursor

a portion of the string, typing a character will replace that portion

	These value editors have an extra check box to the left of the value
	field  which is marked when
	the value is different from its creation value. One may toggle
	between the default and most recent value by pressing the check box
	with the left or middle mouse button.
	The default value may be permanently changed by pressing the check
	box with the right button.
	On the right of the value field is a stepper
	(little button with the	up arrow) that is used to change values in
	lieu of typing a number.
	The stepper works as follows:
	  left mouse button: increase by the increment
	  middle mouse button: decrease by the increment
	  right mouse button: select the increment. Res stands for resolution
	  and means the increment is the least significant digit in the value
	  field. The only other increments are the decades between .001
	  and 1000. When holding down the left or right mouse button, after
	  a short time the stepper will repeatedly increment the value
	  field. Every 20 steps, the increment will increase by a factor of
	  10 but will return to its first step value on release. The repetition
	  mode will not cross 0. To cross 0 release and re-press.
	  Only on release of the mouse button will the action (if any)
	  be executed and finally all value editors will be updated.
	  The default increment starts at the least significant digit in the
	  value field. Stepper delays use the resources:
		*autorepeatStart: .05	//seconds
		*autorepeatDelay: .02

Print & File Window Manager
<p>
Its primary purpose is to organize the windows onto a page for printing. 
The manager contains two scenes representing the screen and a piece of
paper.  The location and relative size of each hoc window appears on the
screen scene. 
<p>
See <a href="../general/function/pwmplace.html#pwman_place">pwman_place</a> .
<p><hr><p>
<h1><a name="ScreenItem">ScreenItem</a></h1>
<pre>
<a href="gui.html#PWM">PWM</a>
</pre>
To specify which subset of windows is to be printed you click on the
relevant rectangles in the screen scene.  A rectangle representing the
relative location and size on the page will appear in the page scene. 
<p>
<p><hr><p>
<h1><a name="PaperItem">PaperItem</a></h1>
<pre>
<a href="gui.html#PWM">PWM</a>
</pre>
Windows selected for printing may be manipulated in the page scene. 
Place the mouse cursor over the desired window rectangle in the page
scene and:
<p>
Right button --- remove the window from the page.  If one clicks again
on that window in the screen scene then the window will return to the
same location and relative size on the page as when it was removed. 
<p>
Middle button --- resize the window.  This resizes not the window on the
screen but how large the window will appear on the page.  The window
always maintains the same aspect ratio as the window on the console
screen.  To resize, drag the mouse with the button down til the desired
size is reached. 
<p>
Left button --- move the window.  Drag the mouse to the desired position
and release the button. 
<p>
When the manager is iconified, all the windows disappear.  When the
manager is redisplayed all the windows come back where they left off.
(This is the case for openlook. Many window managers do not allow easy
dismissing, moving, and resizing of transient windows and therefore
require the use of top level windows which do not iconify as a group)

displayed for any button or menu item that is pressed while
the question mark cursor is present. No actions are executed
in help mode but sometimes dialog boxes may pop up which
should be canceled in order for them not to do anything.
Pressing the help button in help mode will return to
the normal interface with an arrow cursor.
<p>
The help system requires a running Netscape process. If the system
is not working properly on your machine, the help
button can be removed by specifying "*pwm_help: off" in the
nrn/lib/nrn.defaults file.

Pops up a view of the print window manager's screen icon to allow moving

<p>
What makes this useful under mswindows is 1) the fact that it can
be raised to the top of the window hierarchy (The print window manager
can't since it is the parent to all InterViews windows) and 2) there is
a scale button which can scale the window size so all windows will fit

	convenient to find local maxima. On creation the crosshairs starts
	at the nearest point on the line. On dragging it searches from the
	last point for the nearest point but will stop searching if any point
	becomes farther away. This makes it possible to easily follow
	phase plane plots. Crosshairs may call a hoc function on a keypress.
See <a href="../general/classes/graph.html#crosshair">crosshair</a> _action .
<p>
	If no crosshair action has been installed, any keypress will print
	the x,y coordinates of the crosshair in the terminal window.
<p>
	Note that a crosshair_action can obtain all the x,y coordinate data
for a line. Also the global variables <a href="../general/predec.html#hoc_cross_x_">hoc_cross_x_</a> and
<a href="../general/predec.html#hoc_cross_y_">hoc_cross_y_</a> contain the last value of the crosshair coordinates.

	Plot What?: Pops up a browser with which one can navigate to any
	variable (double clicking) to enter it into the field
	editor. Double clicking on object names or section names
	will cause more names to appear in the adjacent browser and allows
	one to quickly build a complete symbol name. Alternatively one
	can directly type or edit the name in the field editor. When you
	are satisfied with the name in the field editor type return or
	press the accept button. The program will check if the name (or
	arbitrary expression) is interpretable and, if so, will be added to
	the list of expressions to be plotted in this graph whenever
	Graph.plot(xvalue) is executed. Warning: some names in the
	browsers are not interpretable or make no sense being plotted.
	If there are inconveniently many names in the first browser,
	you can use the Show menu to reduce the selection to only
	variables, objectvars, sections, or objects. Note that the objects
	allow plotting of variables which may otherwise not be accessible
	to the interpreter because there is no objectvar that references
	them. However, unfortunately, such graph lines cannot be saved in
	a session.
<p>
	If a variable in the browser contains the word [all] in place of
	an explicit index then the Graph will plot it as a function of
its index. See <a href="../general/classes/graph.html#vector">vector</a> .

	If the graph is doing a space plot with a RangeVarPlot then
	the PlotWhat item changes its style to request entry of another
	range variable to plot using the same path. Also one can enter
	an expression involving $1. The expression will be executed for
	each section in the path for each arc position set to $1.

	Change Color: Pops up a color and brush palette to select the
	default color and brush style for the graph.
	Clicking on text or lines will change the line/text to that style.
	After the palette is dismissed it can be retrieved by clicking
	on another radiomenu item and then clicking on this one again.
	Note: Lines associated with labels always have the same color.
	Kept lines are not associated with labels.
	The number of selectable colors and brushes may be set by
	changing the values in your ~/.nrn.defaults file (see CBWidget in

	Graph.begin() is executed in preparation for plotting new lines.
	A useful idiom to save a reference line is to toggle the Keep Lines
	item on and then off.
