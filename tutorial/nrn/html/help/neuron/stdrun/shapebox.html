Shape and browser for creating a section panel
usage: ob = MenuExplore()
<p>
Pressing the left mouse button on a section in the Shape scene (make
sure the "Section" popup menu item is selected) colors the section red and
highlights the corresponding section name in the browser.
<p>
Pressing the left mouse button once on a name in the browser colors
the corresponding section in the Shape Scene (you can drag the mouse as well).
<p>
Double clicking the left mouse button on a name in the browser pops up
a panel showing the parameters associated with that section.
<p>
This assumes homogeneous sections by default. So Parameters which are not
initialized as constants along the section get a label to that effect instead
of a field editor.  If this is not desired specify a position, 0 &LT x &LT 1,
for the location.
<p>
If panels besides PARAMETER are desired select from the "Type" menu.
