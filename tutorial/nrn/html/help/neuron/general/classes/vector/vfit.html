<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<code>error = data_vec.fit(<var>fit_vec</var>,"<var>fcn</var>",<var>indep_vec</var>,<var></var>&p1,[<var></var>&p2],...,[<var></var>&pN])</code><br>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Use a simplex algorithm to find parameters <var>p1</var> through <var>pN</var> such to
minimize the mean squared error between the "data" contained in
<code>data_vec</code> and the approximation generated by the user-supplied "<var>fcn</var>"
applied to the elements of <code>indep_vec</code>.  
<p>
<var>fcn</var> must take one argument which is the main independent variable
followed by one or more arguments which are tunable parameters which
will be optimized.  Thus the arguments to .fit following "<var>fcn</var>" should
be completely analogous to the arguments to fcn itself.  The
difference is that the args to fcn must all be scalars while the
corresponding args to .fit will be a vector object (for the
independent variable) and pointers to scalars (for the remaining
parameters).
<p>
The results of a call to .fit are three-fold.  First, the parameters
of best fit are returned by setting the values of the variables <var>p1</var> to
<var>pN</var> (possible because they are passed as pointers).  Second, the values
of the vector fit_vec are set to the fitted function.  If <code>fit_vec</code> is
not passed with the same size as <code>indep_vec</code> and <code>data_vec</code>, it is resized
accordingly.  Third, the mean squared error between the fitted
function and the data is returned by <code>.fit</code>.  The <code>.fit()</code> call may be
reiterated several times until the error has reached an acceptable
level.
<p>
Care must be taken in selecting an initial set of parameter values.
Although you need not be too close, wild discrepancies will cause the
simplex algorithm to give up.  Values of 0 are to be avoided.  Trial
and error is sometimes necessary.
<p>
Because calls to hoc have a high overhead, this procedure can be
rather slow.  Several commonly-used functions are provided directly
in c code and will work much faster.  In each case, if the name below
is used, the builtin function will be used and the user is expected to
provide the correct number of arguments (here denoted <code>a,b,c</code>...). 
<blockquote><pre>
"exp1": y = a * exp(-x/b)  
"exp2": y = a * exp(-x/b) + c * exp (-x/d)
"charging": y = a * (1-exp(-x/b)) + c * (1-exp(-x/d))
"line": y = a * x + b
"quad": y = a * x^2 + b*x + c
</pre></blockquote>
<h2>BUGS</h2>
This function is not very useful for fitting the results of simulation runs
due to its argument organization. For that purpose the <a href="../../../neuron/nrnoc.html#fit_praxis">fit_praxis</a> syntax
is more suitable. This function should become a top-level function which
merely takes a user error function name and a parameter list.
<p>
An alternative implementation of the simplex fitting algorithm is in
the scopmath library.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
The nrnmainmenu.Miscellaneous.ParameterizedFunction widget uses this function
and is implemented in nrn/lib/hoc/funfit.hoc
<p>
The following example demonstrates the strategy used by the simplex
fitting algorithm to search for a minimum. The location of the parameter
values is plotted on each call to the function.
The sample function has a minimum at the point (1, .5)

<blockquote><pre>
objref g, dvec, fvec, ivec
g = new Graph()
g.size(0,3,0,3)

func fun() {local f
        if ($1 == 0) {
                g.line($2, $3)
                g.flush()
                print $1, $2, $3
        }
        return ($2 - 1)^2 +($3-.5)^2
}


dvec = new Vector(2)
fvec = new Vector(2)
fvec.fill(1)
ivec = new Vector(2)
ivec.indgen()

a = 2
b = 1
g.beginline()
error = dvec.fit(fvec, "fun", ivec, &amp;a, &amp;b)
print a, b, error
